Hi! I'm **Issabel Averina**, a passionate Information Systems and Management student at BINUS University. I love working on data-driven projects and analysing information systems or a dataset to gain insights and improve them.

I'm actively gaining hands-on experience in teaching, mentoring, and administration, and I aim to bring impact through my work.
